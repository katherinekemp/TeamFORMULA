Team FORMULA dynamic wireless power transfer simulations for a highway scenario using DC power.

## About
This simulation uses the Biot Savart Magnetic Toolbox for MATLAB to simulate a highway scenario for an electric vehicle charging wirelessly while in motion.  See the folder [simulations](https://github.com/katherinekemp/TeamFORMULA/tree/main/simulations) for the simulations files, [analysis](https://github.com/katherinekemp/TeamFORMULA/tree/main/analysis) for python scripts that can help make sense of the data, and [latex](https://github.com/katherinekemp/TeamFORMULA/tree/main/latex) for our thesis.

## Thesis
Read our [thesis](https://github.com/katherinekemp/TeamFORMULA/blob/main/thesis.pdf) for detailed information on how the simulations work or view it on University of Maryland's digital repository [here](https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/27070).

## Presentation
