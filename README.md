# Team FORMULA - DWPT
Team FORMULA dynamic wireless power transfer simulations for a highway scenario using DC power.

## About
This simulation uses the Biot Savart Magnetic Toolbox for MATLAB to simulate a highway scenario for an electric vehicle charging wirelessly while in motion.  See the folder "simulations" for the simulations files, "analysis" for python scripts that can help make sense of the data, and "latex" for our thesis.

## Thesis
Read our thesis "thesis.pdf" for detailed information on how the simulations work or view it on University of Maryland's digital repository: https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/27070.

## Presentation
