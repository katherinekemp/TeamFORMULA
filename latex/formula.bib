  abstract = {A non-radiative energy transformer, commonly referred as Witricity and based on `strong coupling' between two coils which are separated physically by medium-range distances, is proposed to realize efficient wireless energy transfer. The distance between the resonators can be larger than the characteristic sizes of each resonator. Non-radiative energy transfer between the first resonator and the second resonator is facilitated through the coupling of their resonant-field evanescent tails. The proposed system operates as traditional inductive magnetic coupling devices when the operating frequencies are not the resonant frequency. Corresponding finite element analysis (FEA) and experiments have been carried out to facilitate quantitative comparison. Compared with typical magnetic inductive coupling energy transmission devices, the efficiency of the proposed system is much higher. This investigation indicates that it is feasible to use wireless energy transfer technology to recharge batteries, particularly in implant devices.},

  abstract   = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming more popular due to concerns about the environment and rising gasoline prices. However, the charging infrastructure is lacking, and most people can only charge their EVs at home if they remember to plug in their cars. Using the principles of magnetic inductance and magnetic resonance, wireless charging (WC) could help signiﬁcantly with these infrastructure problems by making charging secure and convenient. WC systems also have the potential to provide dynamic charging, making long road trips with EVs feasible and eliminating range anxiety. In this paper, we review the companies available in the literature that have developed electric vehicle wireless charging systems, automobile manufacturers interested in such technology, and research from universities and laboratories on the topic. While the ﬁeld is still very young, there are many promising technologies available today. Some systems have already been in use for years, recharging public transit buses at bus stops. Safety and regulations are also discussed.},

  abstract = {As an environment friendly transportation mode, the electric vehicle (EV) has drawn an increasing amount of attention from governments, vehicle manufactories and researchers recently. One of the biggest issue impeding EV’s popularization associates with the charging process. The wireless charging lane (WCL) has been proposed as a convenient charging facility for EVs. Due to the high costs, the application of WCL on the entire freeways is impractical in the near future, while the partial WCL (PWCL) may be a feasible solution. This study aims to evaluate longitudinal safety of EVs with PWCL on freeways based on simulations. The simulation experiments are firstly designed, including deployment of PWCL on freeways and distribution of state of charge (SOC) of EVs. Then, a vehicle behavior model for EVs is proposed based on the intelligent driver model (IDM). Two surrogate safety measures, derived from time-to-collision (TTC), are utilized as indicators for safety evaluations. Sensitivity analysis is also conducted for related factors. Results show that the distribution of EVs’ SOC significantly affect longitudinal safety when the PWCL is utilized. The low SOC in traffic consisting of EVs has the negative effect on longitudinal safety. The randomness and incompliance of EV drivers worsens the safety performance. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the larger maximum deceleration rate results in the higher longitudinal crash risks of EVs, while the length of PWCL has no monotonous effect. Different TTC thresholds also show no impact on results. A case study shows the consistent results. Based on the findings, several suggestions are discussed for EVs’ safety improvement. Results of this study provide useful information for freeway safety when EVs are applied in the future.},

  abstract  = {Wireless power transfer provides an opportunity to charge electric vehicles (EVs) without electrical cables. Two categories of this technique are distinguished: Stationary Wireless Charging (SWC) and Dynamic Wireless Charging (DWC) systems. Implementation of DWC is more desirable than SWC as it can potentially eliminate challenges associated with heavy weight batteries and time-consuming charging processes. However, power transfer efficiency and range, lateral misalignment of coils as well as implementation cost are issues affecting DWC. These issues need to be addressed through developing coil architectures and topologies as well as operating novel semiconductor switches at higher frequencies. This study presents a small-scale dynamic wireless power transfer system for EV. It specifically concentrates on analyzing the dynamic mutual inductance between the coils due to the misalignment as it has significant influence on the EV charging process, particularly, over the output power and overall efficiency. A simulation study is carried out to explore dynamic mutual inductance profile between the transmitter and receiver coils. Mutual inductance simulation results are then verified through practical measurements on fabricated coils. Integrating the practical results into the model, an EV DWC power transfer simulation is conducted and the relation between dynamic mutual inductance and output power are discussed technically.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an autonomous coil alignment system (ACAS) for electric vehicles (EVs) with dynamic wireless charging (DWC) to mitigate the reduction in received power caused by lateral misalignment between the source and load coils. The key component of the ACAS is a novel sensor coil design, which can detect the load coil's left or right position relative to the source coil by observing the change in voltage phase. This allows the lateral misalignment to be estimated through the wireless power transfer (WPT) system alone, which is a novel tracking method for vehicular applications. Once misalignment is detected, the vehicle's lateral position is self-adjusted by an autonomous steering function. The feasibility of the overall operation of the ACAS was verified through simulation and experiments. In addition, an analysis based on experimental results was conducted, demonstrating that 26\% more energy can be transferred during DWC with the ACAS, just by keeping the vehicle's load coil aligned with the source coil.},

Dynamic wireless charging holds promise to partially or completely eliminate the overnight charging through a compact network of dynamic chargers installed on the roads that would keep the vehicle batteries charged at all times, consequently reducing the range anxiety and increasing the reliability of EVs. Dynamic charging can help lower the price of EVs by reducing the size of the battery pack. Indeed, if the recharging energy is readily available, the batteries do not have to support the whole driving range but only supply power when the IPT system is not available. Depending on the power capability, the use of dynamic charging may increase driving range and reduce the size of the battery pack.},

A crossed DD coil design is proposed to solve the "almost zero mutual inductance phenomenon" when EV moves from one primary coil to the next one in this paper. Besides, LCC resonant network is employed in both primary and secondary sides to ensure the constant current, and even to make a better output performance.

  abstract  = {The cruising range of an electric vehicle (EV) can be greatly extended by a dynamic wireless charging system because the battery can be charged while the vehicle is moving. However, the investment in infrastructure can be enormous and has to be reduced to implement the system. This paper presents the design of a wireless power transfer system with road embedded transmitter coils to facilitate dynamic charging of EVs. A 30 cm by 1.6 m transmitter coil, which is relatively long compared with the 40-cm-diameter circular receiver coil, has been designed to reduce the cost of the transmitter circuit. A prototype transmitter coil has been embedded into a road for evaluation of its characteristics. The measured coupling coefficient of the transmitter and receiver coils is as small as 0.09 because of the asymmetry between the coils. Compensation circuits for the transmitter and receiver coils have been designed and optimized for such a small coupling coefficient condition. The designed dynamic charging system can transfer more than 1 kW of electric power with more than 90\% efficiency. Five transmitter circuits have been embedded into a road surface for testing. Cement asphalt mortar was used to construct the road surface in this study to avoid damaging the transmitter coils by high temperature and high pressure during the construction work. The designed receiver circuit has been installed on a compact 2-seater EV. A demonstration was conducted to show that the retrofitted EV can successfully receive electric power transferred from the road.},

  abstract = {This study explores suitability of battery electric vehicles in the United States by considering their potential market share and operations costs as well as the state-specific variations in electricity generation profiles, given current government policies and the social acceptability of the technology. A performance assessment is developed to compare each state and identify major policy efforts that are needed to increase the environmental and economic competitiveness of electric vehicles. A novel multi-criteria decision-support framework, integrating Life Cycle Assessment, Data Envelopment Analysis, and Agent Based Modeling, is developed. To this end, the environmental and economic impacts of battery electric vehicles are calculated based on three scenarios: an average electricity generation mix, a marginal electricity generation mix, and a solely renewable energy mix with 100\% solar. The states are classified, each requiring different policy strategies, in accordance with their performance scores. The results provide important insights for advancing transportation policies and a novel framework for multi-criteria decision-making in the future analyses.},

  abstract = {Alternative vehicles, such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, are becoming more popular. The batteries of these plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are to be charged at home from a standard outlet or on a corporate car park. These extra electrical loads have an impact on the distribution grid which is analyzed in terms of power losses and voltage deviations. Without coordination of the charging, the vehicles are charged instantaneously when they are plugged in or after a fixed start delay. This uncoordinated power consumption on a local scale can lead to grid problems. Therefore, coordinated charging is proposed to minimize the power losses and to maximize the main grid load factor. The optimal charging profile of the plug-in hybrid electric vehicles is computed by minimizing the power losses. As the exact forecasting of household loads is not possible, stochastic programming is introduced. Two main techniques are analyzed: quadratic and dynamic programming. © 2009 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Electrified transportation will help to reduce green-house gas emissions and increasing petrol prices. Electrified transportation demands that a wide variety of charging networks be set up, in a user-friendly environment, to encourage adoption. Wireless electric vehicle charging systems (WEVCS) can be a potential alternative technology to charge the electric vehicles (EVs) without any plug-in problems. This paper outlines the current available wireless power transfer technology for EVs. In addition, it also includes wireless transformer structures with a variety of ferrite shapes, which have been researched. WEVCS are associated with health and safety issues, which have been discussed with the current development in international standards. Two major applications, static and dynamic WEVCS, are explained, and up-to-date progress with features from research laboratories, universities, and industries are recorded. Moreover, future upcoming concepts-based WEVCS, such as “vehicle-to-grid (V2G)” and “in-wheel” wireless charging systems (WCS) are reviewed and examined, with qualitative comparisons with other existing technology.},

Electricity onboard a car can be provided either by a battery or a fuel cell (FCV). The technical structure of BEV is described, clarifying that it is relatively simple compared to ICEV. Following that, ICEV can be ‘e-converted’ by experienced personnel. Such an e-conversion project generated reality-close data reported here.},

To the contrary, this report presents the ﬁrst evidence that long-term EMF exposure directly associated with cell phone use (918 MHz; 0.25 W/kg) provides cognitive beneﬁts. Both cognitive-protective and cognitive-enhancing effects of EMF exposure were discovered for both normal mice and transgenic mice destined to develop Alzheimer’s-like cognitive impairment. The cognitive interference task utilized in this study was designed from, and measure-for-measure analogous to, a human cognitive interference task. In Alzheimer’s disease mice, long-term EMF exposure reduced brain amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition through Aβ anti-aggregation actions and increased brain temperature during exposure periods. Several inter-related mechanisms of EMF action are proposed, including increased Aβ clearance from the brains of Alzheimer’s disease mice, increased neuronal activity, and increased cerebral blood ﬂow. Although caution should be taken in extrapolating these mouse studies to humans, we conclude that EMF exposure may represent a non-invasive, non-pharmacologic therapeutic against Alzheimer’s disease and an effective memory-enhancing approach in general.},

Using an environmental justice paradigm this study applies Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial analysis to determine whether certain vulnerable human populations are unequally exposed to pollution from unconventional gas wells in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio. Several GIS-based approaches were used to identify exposed areas, and a t-test was used to find statistically significant differences between rural populations living close to wells and rural populations living farther away. Sociodemographic indicators include age (children and the elderly), poverty level, education level, and race at the census tract level. Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA) technique was applied to find spatial clusters where both high well density and high proportions of vulnerable populations occur. The results demonstrate that the environmental injustice occurs in areas with unconventional wells in Pennsylvania with respect to the poor population. There are also localized clusters of vulnerable populations in exposed areas in all three states: Pennsylvania (for poverty and elderly population), West Virginia (for poverty, elderly population, and education level) and Ohio (for children).},

A dynamic wireless power transfer (WPT) system is one of the effective solutions, because it can feed electric power to moving EVs. This paper proposes a dynamic WPT system consisting of several stationary ground-side (primary) coils and a moving vehicle-side (secondary) coil. This system is characterized by the use of the common vehicle-side coil to both dynamic and stationary WPT situations. Theoretical analysis concludes that the dynamic WPT system resulting from a stationary WPT system is the same in equivalent circuit as the stationary system. The dynamic WPT system employs solenoid coils that are superior to circular coils in terms of misalignment and flux-distribution performance. A downscaled dynamic WPT system rated at 3 kW is designed, constructed, and tested to verify the principles of operation, and the capability of continuous power transfer.},

  abstract   = {Innovation ecosystems evolve and adapt to crises, but what are the factors that stimulate ecosystem growth in spite of dire circumstances? We study the arduous path forward of the electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem and analyse in depth those factors that influence ecosystem growth in general and during the pandemic in particular. For the EV ecosystem, growth implies outcompeting the less sustainable internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, thus achieving a transition towards sustainable transportation. New mobility patterns provide a strategic opportunity for such a shift to green mobility and for EV ecosystem growth. For innovation ecosystems in general, we suggest that a crisis can serve as an opportunity for new innovations to break through by disrupting prior behavioural patterns. For the EV ecosystem in particular, it remains to be seen if the ecosystem will be able to capitalize on the opportunity provided by the unfortunate disruption generated by the pandemic.},
