Team FORMULA would like to extend our thanks to our mentor Bryan Quinn for providing us with guidance, as well as lab space, equipment, and materials for our project. We would like to thank Siavash Toosi for lending his time and expertise in MATLAB to help with designing our simulations. We would like to thank Shawn Fickes and Brian Beaudoin for helping to construct our experimental model, which would not have been possible without their generous help throughout the pandemic. We would like to thank our former librarian Kelsey Corlett-Rivera for her help in writing our project proposal and in winning the Librarianâ€™s Award in order to secure funding for our team. We would like to thank our current librarian Sarah Over for serving on our committee and helping to write our thesis. We would like to acknowledge our discussants for taking the time to read our thesis and provide valuable feedback. We would like to thank all of the Gemstone faculty and staff for their support, especially over the last year. Finally, we would like to pay our gratitude and respects to our former teammate Trevor Quinn. Trevor had an immense impact on our team and research through the insightful and positive attitude he brought to every meeting.
