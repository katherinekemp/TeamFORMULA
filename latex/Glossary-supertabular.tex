Current & Flow of electric charge \\
Diode & A circuit element with two terminals that only allows current to flow in one direction \\
Dynamic charging & The act of achieving power transfer to a battery by means of movement between a transmitting and receiving coil \\
Dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) & WPT of a moving entity, such as an EV \\
Electrical potential & The potential energy of an electrical charge \\
Electrical resistance & Opposition to the flow of electric charge \\
Electromagnetic Field & The physical field resulting from the change in velocity of a moving charged particle \\
Electromagnetic induction & The production of an electromagnetic field through a conductor via a changing magnetic field \\
Electromotive force (EMF) & A difference in electrical potential \\
Evanescent field & Oscillating electric or magnetic field that does not spread as an electromagnetic wave, and has no net energy flow in that region \\
Galvanometer & An instrument used to measure electrical current \\
Joule & SI unit of work (energy), 1 J = 1 NÃ—m \\
Magnetic field & The area around a magnetic material or a moving electrical charge that exerts a force on a moving electrical charge \\
Magnetic flux & A measure of the flow of a magnetic field through a given area \\

Resonators & Device that exhibits resonance or resonant behavior \\
Single-phase full-wave rectifier & A rectifier that is able to convert both the positive and negative parts of an alternating current into direct current \\
Single-phase half-wave rectifier & A rectifier that is only able to convert the positive part of an alternating current into direct current \\
Skin effect & The tendency of a high-frequency alternating current to flow through only the outer layer of a conductor \\
Solenoid & A coil of wire that acts as a magnet due to a current passing through it \\
Voltage & Electromotive force in terms of volts \\
